### Stateless vs Stateful widget:
   A widget is either stateful or stateless. If a widget can change—when a user interacts with it, for example—it's stateful. A stateless widget never changes. ... A stateful widget is dynamic: for example, it can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data.
